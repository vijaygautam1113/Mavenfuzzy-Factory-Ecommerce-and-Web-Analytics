# Mavenfuzzy-Factory-Ecommerce-and-Web-Analytics
Mavenfuzzy Factory is an e-commerce company selling teddy bears. I joined them as a data analyst to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure, and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.This project belongs to timeline ‘2012-03-19’ and ‘2015-03-19’. I worked as I was in the year 2012 starting to help them analyze. All communications will be in the same year as the dataset. I used SQL programming to find trends and insights.
Here are the following tasks I will help them:
