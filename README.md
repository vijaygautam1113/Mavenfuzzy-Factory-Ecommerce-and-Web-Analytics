Mavenfuzzy Factory is an e-commerce company selling teddy bears. I joined them as a data analyst to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure, and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.This project belongs to timeline ‘2024-03-19’ and ‘2024-07-19’.
